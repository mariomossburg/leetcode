# the remainder after dividing ::: a%b=r
# so 10 % 8 = 2

# to go even further, if you are to think of how many times 
# the right number goes into the left number, the result 
# will be the remainder 
print(10%8)

# when you're modding by a number larger than itself, 
# it returns the number in full. for example 8 % 10 = 8  
print(8%10)
