# Ways to speed up progam

# ****Summary of Techniques for Smaller-Scale Tasks:

# ****Caching (Redis, in-memory cache)

# ****Async programming (using asyncio for I/O-bound tasks)

# ****Multithreading (for I/O-bound tasks like API requests)

# ****Optimized data structures (use dicts, sets, or generators)

# ****Efficient file handling (batch reads, buffered I/O)

# ****Database connection pooling (SQLAlchemy, prepared statements)

# ****Minimize blocking operations and use a lightweight framework (FastAPI, Flask)
